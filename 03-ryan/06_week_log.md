# Week 6 Tasks Completed
* Fixed Equation Indices, cleaned equations, added missing summary equations and tables
* Worked ~7 Hours
# Comments
* I tried to work off of my previous commit that had the missing summary equations and tables, but when trying to revert to this, there were far too many merge conflicts, so I ended up just having to rewrite these summary equations.
* There are a lot of drop down menus with the title of "Click to view analysis table". I'm unsure where these came from or what their purpose is, so I didn't try to fold in the summary equations there, but rather just kept the equations separate.
* Since I spent an unexpected amount of time trying to figure out how to revert the files on github before having to eventually rework the equations manually, I didn't get around to working on kableExtra
