# Week 7 Tasks
* Added equations to most of the model types on the shiny app
* Worked ~4 Hours
* I'm highly uncertain as to the correctness of the equations, so I will create a pull request so you can see what changes I made, but I doubt the changes should actually be merged at this time.
* I am unsure of the differences between "fiscal effects" and "total effects", as well as how to take into account externalities in the equation.
