# Week 4 Completed
* Dynamically numbered equations in deworming DD; added foldability to table in DD; looked over equation in shiny app to determine derivation and noted questions.
* Time worked - 5 Hours

# Questions
* What does tau represent? It is in the equation, but I can't find reference to it anywhere in the DD.
* For the other model types, what are the externalities mentioned, and how is that calculated? Since E<sub>t</sub> isn't broken down in the displayed equation, would the externality parameter &lambda;<sub>2</sub> even need to show up in the shiny app?
