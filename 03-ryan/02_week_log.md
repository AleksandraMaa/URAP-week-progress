# URAP Week 2 Progress
* Research Deworm the World, read through website and summarized
* Read through and interpreted deworming dynamic doc code and analysis. Recorded relevant Questions
* Proposed some additions to Bones rmd file to make it more helpful/complete
* Hours Worked: ~10-11

## Deworm the World Summary
Parasitic worms are a major issue across much of the underdeveloped world.
By administering a simple pill through schools, impoverished children's long term prospects
can be greatly improved, all for a cost of less than 50 cents per child per year.
Deworm the world partners with governments globally to advocate, survey, mobilize, train and
coordinate the effective implementation of deworming practices.
Deworm the world is a top ranked deworming charity, and has previously had great success aiding
India and Kenya in their deworming initiatives, along with other regions. In 2018, DTW treated
just under 300 million at-risk children. In the future,
DTW looks to focus on high risk groups, such as children in Pakistan and Nigeria.
Extensive evidence points to deworming students leading to much higher rates of school participation
and learning in general, which translates to improved chances of success later in life.
Although mass treatment means that many uninfected children will be treated, there is no harm in
doing so, so this treatment method is general seen as the most effective means of minimizing infections.

## Deworming DD Questions
* I had an issue when knitting the Rmd file, where an error was thrown. I was able to work around it by
commenting out a line relating to the bibliography, but I don't understand why this happened.
Any ideas on what is happening would be greatly appreciated, I can show you the error on Monday.
* Why is the Kenyan bond yield used as the discount rate for the calculations? My understanding is that
the discount rate is supposed to be the "risk free return on capital" which isn't exactly true for Kenyan bonds.
Why is it more appropriate to use the Kenyan bond yield over a different, less risky bond?
* What does the variable Q represent?
* What's the difference between right and left joins (from around line 940)?
