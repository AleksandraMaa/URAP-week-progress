## Reports
1. [Complete Diagram for Approach 1](https://github.com/sophiabai2022/URAP-week-progress/blob/master/04-sophia/Week%207/Diagram_1st_Approach.Rmd)
![](Week%207/Diagram_1st_Approach.png)
  - potential problems:
    - what is variable "ex" represent? --> exchange rate
2. [Complete Diagram for Approach 2](https://github.com/sophiabai2022/URAP-week-progress/blob/master/04-sophia/Week%207/Diagram_2nd_Approach.Rmd)
![](Week%207/Diagram_2nd_Approach.png)
  - potential problems:
    - Hard to visualize how each function change, when the variables do not change (eg. DC changes) - maybe we can put note to let people know that the formula changed
3. [Complete Diagram for Approach 3](https://github.com/sophiabai2022/URAP-week-progress/blob/master/04-sophia/Week%207/Diagram_3rd_Approach.Rmd)
![](Week%207/Diagram_3rd_Approach.png)
  - potential problems:
    - the relationships are a bit confusing, I need to double check with Fernando to make sure it is correct
4. [Notations for the diagrams](https://github.com/sophiabai2022/URAP-week-progress/blob/master/04-sophia/Week%207/notations.Rmd)
![An example of notations](Week%207/notation.png)
- potential problems: too much notations make diagram crowded, need to discuss another way
