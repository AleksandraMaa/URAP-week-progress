# Week 5
## Tasks
1. figure out how to change the text on the edges systematicaaly 
   - eg. define a variable, and be able to replace it
2. Update the fork
3. Populate the tables in the 05_final_opa.Rmd
   - make a guess of if the number is coming from data, research, or guesswork
   - make a table under 'click here to see the analysis table'
   - make changes in my repo doc, and then pull it

## Reports
1. figure out how to change the text on the edges systematicaaly (eg. define a variable, and be able to replace it)
   - I looked up online, and so far could not find a way to do that with GrizV (the method I used to construct the diagram) 
   - There might be other ways to do this, but the structure of the diagram needs to be changed (ie. not using GrizV to construct the diagram, and use, for example, make_graph)
   
2. Update the fork ~ 15 mins
   - I both updated the opa-dewarming folder and the weekly progress folder.
   
3. Populate the tables in the 05_final_opa.Rmd
   - I populate the tables
   - problems/confusions:
     - How to add space between each columns
     - Where I should add the tables and where I should not
     - What are the variables I should include?
     - Where I can find the value of the variables?
