## Areas I want to explore further in future semesters

- First, I really want to take this time to thank you for a great semester and an interesting URAP experience! This semester, I had learned a lot, including R shiny, R markdown, Github, and DiagrammeR. Those are all valuable skills and experience. I really appreciated your guidence and help throughout the semester! 
- Second, as for areas that I would want to explore further in future semesters, since I have learned some skills throughout this semester, I hope I can make more impact and contribute more to the real projects. I understand that I might not be able to truly contribute unless I have solid skills, so I think you made a great decision to let us learn first. Maybe next semester, since I have learned some skills, I hope I could really contribute to your projects and apply my tools in a real-life project.
- Thirdly, I have learned applied econometrics this semester, so if possible, I hope I could code and analyze more data.
- Lastly, I want to thank you again for a great semester and URAP experience! Thank you, Fernando!
