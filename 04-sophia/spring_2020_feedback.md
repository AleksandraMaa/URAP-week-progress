## Areas I want to explore further in future semesters

- First, I really want to take this time to thank you for a great semester and interesting URAP experience! This semester, I had learned a lot, including R shiny, R markdown, Github, and DiagrammeR. Those are all valuable skills and experience. I really appreciated your guidence and help throughout the semester!
