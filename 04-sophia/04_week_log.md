## Tasks

   - add texts
   - func maybe change nodes and levels
2. read documents code - 05_final_opa.Rmd


## Reports
1. Building more diagrams ~ 4 hours
   - [A More Complex Diagrams](https://github.com/sophiabai2022/URAP-week-progress/blob/master/04-sophia/Week%204/More_diagrams.Rmd)
   - [incomplete function building diagrams more systematically](https://github.com/sophiabai2022/URAP-week-progress/blob/master/04-sophia/Week%204/Function_build_diagrams.Rmd)
2. Read 05_final_opa.Rmd ~ 1 hour
   - Questions
     - function writing tutorial/resources?
     - for loop? Lambdas? I know what they are in python, but in R, I am not as familiar
     - More documentation on Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA)?
     - Is this how the R shiny work?
     - Couldn't knit when I knit to pdf
     - How could I interpret the output graph?
   - What I know:
     - latex in the markdown file
     - short/simple functions
   - Tips for others who read this doc:
     - easier to read when knit to pdf file
     - if couldn't knit, you can view the latex on Overleaf.com

## Meeting Notes
1. Maybe try the paste() func for diagram func; but maybe forget about it...
2. [Docs on Generating diagrams more systematically](https://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/traversals.html)
