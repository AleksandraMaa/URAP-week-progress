# Summary of My Work

## Week by Week

##### Week 1
During week 1, I read the [OPA paper](https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/jnyqh) and wrote a short summary about it (which can be found in my weekly log). I also finished the assigned R markdown tutorial.

##### Week 2
During week 2, I read the dynamic documentation for the [Wealth Tax analysis](http://wealthtaxsimulator.org/analysis/) and studied the Rmd file for it as well. I also started researching deworming and reading the [EvidenceAction website](https://www.evidenceaction.org/dewormtheworld-2/).

##### Week 3
During week 3, I finished reading the [EvidenceAction website](https://www.evidenceaction.org/dewormtheworld-2/) and wrote a summary for it (this summary can be found in several locations - my reports + summary folder under deworming and in the [Tutorials repo](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/Tutorials/blob/master/Summaries/Deworming/Deworm%20the%20World%20-%20summary)). I also looked over the Rmd file for deworming ([05_final_opa](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/opa-deworming/blob/master/code/05_final_opa.Rmd)) as well as the [00_bones file](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/opa-deworming/blob/master/code/00_bones.Rmd) and some smaller changes to both.

##### Week 4
During week 4, I completed a summary about the cost-effectiveness of deworming (which can be found in several locations - my reports and summary folder under deworming and in the [Tutorials repo](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/Tutorials/blob/master/Summaries/Deworming/Deworming%20Cost-Effectiveness%20-%20summary)). I also started reading the [Minimum Wage CBO Report](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2019-07/CBO-55410-MinimumWage2019.pdf).

##### Week 5
During week 5, I finish summarizing the Minimum Wage CBO Report (which can be found in several locations - my reports and summary folder under minimum wage and in the [Tutorials repo](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/Tutorials/blob/master/Summaries/Minimum%20Wage/CBO%20Minimum%20Wage%20Report%20-%20summary)). I also figured out how to update forked repos and [wrote a tutorial for it](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/Tutorials/blob/master/GitHub/updating%20forked%20repos.md) in the new [Tutorials repo](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/Tutorials) I created.

##### Week 6
During week 6, I finished reviewing the 05_final_opa deworming md file and started cataloguing all the areas I felt needed additional work (the line-by-line changes that I recommended can be found in [my weekly log](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/URAP-week-progress/blob/master/02-orianna/01_weekly_log.md)).

##### Week 7 + 8
During weeks 7 and 8, I read the two cited studies from the deworming document ([Baird et. al 16](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/Tutorials/tree/master/Summaries/Deworming/Worms%20At%20Work%20-%20Baird%20et.%20al%2016) and [Baird et. al 20](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/Tutorials/tree/master/Summaries/Deworming/Twenty%20Year%20Economic%20Impact%20-%20Baird%20et.%20al%2020)).

##### Week 9
During week 9, I created a [summaries folder](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/Tutorials/tree/master/Summaries) in the Tutorials repo, added all my relevant documents, and updated the ReadMe file. I also created [a checklist/structure](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/URAP-week-progress/blob/master/02-orianna/deworming%20changes) for how to tackle the large changes to the 05_final_opa document that I am suggesting.

##### Week 10
During week 10, I created this document, converted any remaining materials I developed or learned into relevant tutorials, and created a list of tasks that should be pursued further in the future (which can be found in either this document or my weekly log).

## Suggestions for the Future
### The Deworming File
- have a conversation about what the purpose of this report is
- clarify the methodology of the third approach - how does the GiveWell analysis fit into this and how was it modified
- implement the changes suggested in my [deworming changes](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/URAP-week-progress/blob/master/02-orianna/deworming%20changes) document

### URAP Suggestions
#### Policy Outreach
- I would recommend making sure that the policy outreach portion has a greater emphasis; luckily, I was interested in doing both policy outreach and data analysis, but I would say that most of my work was related to data analysis and the working on the deworming report rather than outreach to other organizations
- I think having a greater emphasis on learning more about the policy report writing process would be helpful; I'm still not sure I totally understand how writing reports is traditionally approached and I think it would be helpful to know before jumping into writing a new type of policy report

#### R/md
- I think we should create some basic R/md tutorials and our own personalized cheat sheet or compile the most useful cheat sheets so that future URAPs will have an easier learning curve
- more guidance on R/md training - I wasn't really sure what I needed to learn, so I would have appreciated more pointers on where and what I should be looking for. I also felt like my knowledge was fairly limited as I personally only really learned about r and r markdown, but I think it would've been interesting to learn about some of the other aspects if time allowed.

#### Collaboration
- I wish there had been more opportunities for collaboration with other URAPs. Although part of the issue was the in-person interactions were cut short halfway through the semester, I think that there could've been more opportunities for us to be paired together in our work, which would have been the learning curve on some things easier.

#### Miscellaneous 
- I think that the weekly meetings could be more efficiently utilized.
