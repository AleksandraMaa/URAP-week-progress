### Week 3
- Task:  read the [deworming website](https://www.evidenceaction.org/dewormtheworld-2/) on deworming + write a summary of it

##### My Summary  
Parasitic worm infections, also known as soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and schistosomiasis, interfere with regular bodily processes by decreasing nutrient uptake and thereby contributing to malnourishment and impairment of mental and physical development. Evidence Action advocates for mass school-based deworming because of the impact on school participation, nutrition and cognition, and the cost-effective nature of mass treatment. Their partnership model focuses on seven components:
1. Policy and Advocacy - working with governments to launch deworming programs and working with "ministries of health and education to establish effective policies and governance structures"
2. Prevalence Surveying and Mapping - working to assess the prevalence and intensity of worm distribution through field surveys
3. Program Planning and Management - working with governments to design their deworming programs, develop operational plans and budgets, coordinate logistics, and providing on-the-ground support
4. Public Awareness and Mobilization - developing locally appropriate campaigns that educate communities about the negative effects of worms, the importance of deworming, and how to prevent further infections
5. Training and Distribution Cascade - supporting governments in the design and coordination of "efficient multi-tier training and distribution cascades" that are tailored to the relevant local context.  
i.e., the cascade from national level --> state level --> teachers (who administer the deworming drugs)
6. Drug Management and Coordination - evaluating appropriate treatment strategies, aiding in drug procurement (including through pharmaceutical donation programs), and developing robust protocols for tracking drug inventories
7. Monitoring and Evaluation - helping governments design systems to monitor and measure effectiveness of programs in achieving intended results. They also conduct independent monitoring to validate such results and to evaluate the impact of the programs in reducing worm prevalence and intensity.  

Active in: Nigeria, Ethiopia, Kenya, Pakistan, India, Vietnam

### Week 4
- Task: Detailed summary of the [deworming cost-effectiveness article](https://www.evidenceaction.org/2017-deworming-cost-effectiveness/); ~1 sentence per paragraph

##### My Summary
###### introduction
Evidence Action's Deworm the World Initiative wants to implement a program that is cost-effective, not merely low-cost. In short, they want to ensure that the impacts of the program are quantifiable and that the benefits of the program outweigh the costs. They indicate that a policy is cost-effective when "the cost is *worth the value* of the impact." While they cannot directly measure the benefits of their treatment plans and policies, as that would require measurement of the treatment group against a control, they utilize external studies that have measured the impact of deworming.

###### Calculating Costs (2017) - Cost/Child results
They calculate the cost of deworming a child on an annual basis for each geographic region using a combination of their own financial data and government/partner cost estimates (which includes the estimated value of donated drugs and costs of surveys that assess worm burden/density).  

In 2017, they found that the average cost/child per treatment across all areas was $0.07. They also offered results by geography, which ranged from $0.05 to $0.65. Costs varied across geographies due to differences in the "scale of the program, treatment strategies, costs of doing business, implementation partnership relationships, and the amount of time the program has been running." They aim to keep costs below $0.50 per child per treatment round.

###### Estimating Effectiveness Beyond Health benefits
Although quantifying the benefits of deworming is more complicated, Evidence Action relies on the published work of researchers which have examined both short-term and long-term benefits. The foremost benefit is the effect deworming has on health, which is critical to future productivity and quality of life. Early investments in health are crucial to optimizing the amount of healthy time which can be devoted to activities later in life (Grossman).

Deworming also provides benefits beyond direct health impacts, as poor health in children has long-term consequences such as physical disadvantages in the workforce or reduced educational achievement which leads to "lower wage earnings in adulthood."

In summary, there are many possible mechanisms by which deworming treatment can lead to long-term economic advantages, and there is a clear linkage between [deworming and productivity/income](https://www.evidenceaction.org/a-summary-of-the-deworming-evidence-base/) even if some of the exact processes are not fully understood.


###### The Evidence
Evidence Action cite several results from a study published by Miguel and Kremer in 2004:
- 25% reduction in absenteeism after children were dewormed in Kenya
- Reported feeling less fatigue and an increased ability to focus at school --> *more present and attentive in class*
- increased girls' rate of passing the primary school exit exam + enter secondary school by 9.5% --> *demonstrating improved school performance and achievement*

Additionally, other research shows that additional years of education lead to higher incomes in the future as more schooling allows students to develop skills that are beneficial in future careers ("trigger greater labor productivity and earnings").

There are also some studies which demonstrated cognitive gains as a result of deworming.

In short, there are multiple pathways through which deworming can impact long-term productivity and income gains which is reflected in a longitudinal study which followed students that were dewormed as children into adulthood. The study found that the dewormed children had higher wages compared to those who were not dewormed and men that were dewormed as boys "worked 17% more hours each week and missed one fewer meal per week."

However, it is difficult to isolate the casual mechanism between deworming and improved economic outcomes, so there are relatively few studies which demonstrate the long-term impacts of deworming. However, they expect new studies to be published soon which should expand current understandings of the long-term impacts. Going forward, they wish to conduct further analyses of the aforementioned studies so that they may further "define and improve [their] models for the cost-effectiveness of [their] programs"
