# Weekly Progress

## General Tasks
- create pull request on Fridays to merge my local copy of the GitHub w/ the master

## Week 1
Assigned Tasks:
- read the [OPA paper](https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/jnyqh) linked in the powerpoint and write a few sentences summarizing my thoughts on it (1-3 hours)
- read the [dynamic document](http://wealthtaxsimulator.org/analysis/) for the wealth tax --> model for whether future pieces are opinion pieces or policy analysis
- do the [tutorial](https://resources.rstudio.com/the-essentials-of-data-science/getting-started-with-r-markdown-60-02) on R markdown files (1 hour tutorial)
- read the [documentation](https://www.evidenceaction.org/dewormtheworld-2/) on deworming + write a summary of it (if time)


Week 1 Progress:
- Read the OPA paper:  
Public policy suffers from the same kind of reproducibility crisis as has been observed in other empirical sciences. In public policy analysis, it is specifically due to cherry picking of weak evidence, inefficiencies and difficulty in automating systemically recurring reports, and difficulties in drawing clear links between how research and assumptions informs specific analyses. The best way to combat this is to follow the TOP guidelines and to embrace the three principles of open policy analysis: open outputs, open analysis, and open materials.
- finished the R markdown tutorial  

Total time: ~5 hours

## Week 2
Assigned Tasks:
- read the [dynamic document](http://wealthtaxsimulator.org/analysis/) for the wealth tax --> model for whether future pieces are opinion pieces or policy analysis
- look at the Rmd file for the dynamic document (in the [wealthtax repo](https://github.com/oriajia/opa-wealthtax/tree/master/code/dynamic_doc))
  - try to run the Rmd file + try to reproduce the reports
  - note any questions and comments
- read the [documentation](https://www.evidenceaction.org/dewormtheworld-2/) on deworming + write a summary of it (note: spend bulk of time here)

Week 2 Progress:
- read the wealth tax dynamic documentation
- studied and ran the Rmd file for the wealth tax dynamic documentation
- had a cursory look at the deworming website, but not a thorough review

Total time: ~3.5 hours
