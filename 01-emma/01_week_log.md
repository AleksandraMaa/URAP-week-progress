# Week 1
## 1/2 sentences on activities -> Friday first pull request
1) [OPA](https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/jnyqh), Current policy analysis is difficult to distinguish from policy advocacy, lacks widespread public credibility, and is suffering from a  reproducibility crisis. To combat this, we can promote open policy analyses, which utilize open materials, analysis and output presented in 4 layers.

2) look at [dynamic doc](http://wealthtaxsimulator.org/analysis/) for wealth tax: write 1-2 sentences

The dynamic document on Warren's Wealth Tax describes its methodology and assumptions at each step, and provides the code needed to reproduce the analysis. In addition, the code is readable to humans because of comments that describe each step. When data is confidential, the code cell includes comments with instructions to obtain the data, like in section 3.1 under Data cleaning.

3) tutorial on rmd

4) read deworming; summarize + key issues

at end of week, report on 3 items: activities, hours, deliverables for next week (later weeks)
### pull request at end of week
