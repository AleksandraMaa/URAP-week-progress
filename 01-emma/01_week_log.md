# Week 1

### Tasks completed
1) Read and summarize [OPA](https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/jnyqh) document
  Current policy analysis is difficult to distinguish from policy advocacy, lacks widespread public credibility, and is suffering from a  reproducibility crisis. To combat this, we can promote open policy analyses, which utilize open materials, analysis and output presented in 4 layers.

2) Read[dynamic doc](http://wealthtaxsimulator.org/analysis/) for wealth tax: write 1-2 sentences on what distinguishes this as a policy analysis instead of an opinion piece
  The dynamic document on Warren's Wealth Tax describes its methodology and assumptions at each step, and provides the code needed to reproduce the analysis. In addition, the code is readable to humans because of comments that describe each step. When data is confidential, the code cell includes comments with instructions to obtain the data, like in section 3.1 under Data cleaning.

3) Watch [R Markdown Tutorial](https://resources.rstudio.com/the-essentials-of-data-science/getting-started-with-r-markdown-60-02)
I learned to create an a file in R markdown, specify different output types, and make the output/report reproducible with the help of parameters.

I didn't get to task 4, examining [Evidence Action's website](https://www.evidenceaction.org/dewormtheworld-2/); completing tasks 1-3 took me **9 hours** this week.
