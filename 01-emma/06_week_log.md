# Week 6

### Tasks
1. *Continue adding narrative descriptions for equations in 05_final_opa.Rmd*  

* I didn't immediately understand 9, will have to review next time to see if I can explain R and p in without referring too much to the equation for E<sub>t</sub>. I think I should revise the description for E<sub>t</sub> so it makes more sense in context.
* I updated descriptions for equations 10, 13 and 14 and added collapsed/folded Equations sections for 13 and 14.

##### Questions
*confused/lack of understanding on S<sub>1,2</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub> under approach 1 (equations 11, 12)*
* Are S<sub>1,2</sub> equal to the value of the subsidy in each case or "the take-up under a mass deworming intervention"? Later Q<sub>2</sub> is described as the take-up with full subsidy.
* What is the role of ex in the equation for the complete subsidy S<sub>2</sub>?

*2.3.1 Gains in earnings*
* Is there a reason for the "AQUI VOY" under gains in earnings


I worked for **9 hours** this week.
