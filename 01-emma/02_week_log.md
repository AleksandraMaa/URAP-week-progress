# Week 2

### Tasks Completed
1. [Evidence Action](https://www.evidenceaction.org/dewormtheworld-2/) summary  

  Evidence Action supports and scales evidence-based, cost-effective programs with measurable impacts to alleviate issues of poverty. In 2013, Evidence Action started managing the [Deworm the World Initiative](https://www.evidenceaction.org/dewormtheworld/), originally managed by Innovations for Poverty Action.  

  The key issue Deworm the World is addressing is the risk of parasitic worm infections in Africa and Asia. The infections, soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and schistosomiasis, disproportionately affect poor populations because of poor sanitation and open defecation. Of the 835 million pre-school and school-age children at risk globally, the initiative treats 270 million children a year in India, Kenya, Nigeria, and Pakistan, and previously in Ethiopia and Vietnam, at a cost of less than $0.50 per child. In these countries, the initiative takes advantage of existing infrastructure by promoting school-based deworming - this has positive effects on school participation and on nutrition. Mass treatment is preferred to screening each child because it is less expensive per individual, and the drugs are simultaneously effective for treatment and safe for uninfected. This is in accordance with the WHO's recommendation for mass treatment in areas where at least 20% of children are infected.  

2. Read dynamic doc on deworming (05 rmd file) - try to compile/knit  

  I read through the markdown file for the deworming dynamic doc but I wasn't able to find a solution for the error `pandoc-citeproc: Could not find bibliography.bib`, and I couldn't find a file bibliography.bib in the deworming folder. I corrected a few typos up to line 712 (before approach 2).  

3. Corrected typos in wealth tax dynamic doc  

  I corrected typos in comments and in the text, but encountered new issues that I didn't observe in the [completed wealth doc](http://wealthtaxsimulator.org/analysis/). Specifically, footnotes 1 and 2 in the header next to the author names didn't appear in the resulting html, which also caused footnotes 3 and 4 to display as footnotes 1 and 2 on the knitted html. I also added the code chunk option `warning = FALSE` in section 5.  

I worked for **9 hours** this week on tasks 1-3.
