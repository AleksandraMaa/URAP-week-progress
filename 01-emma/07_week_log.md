# Week 7

### Tasks
1. *Continue adding narrative descriptions for equations in 05_final_opa.Rmd*  

I added description and folded section for equations 15 and 16 (direct costs) under approach 2 costs. I also added a description and folded section for equation 17 (indirect cost of schooling) under approach 2.  

I started reading about Evidence Action's approach but I didn't get to creating narrative descriptions for equations under approach 3.  

I think it would be helpful to go over how much information should be included under the folded 'Equations' section - it's possible that I'm including information that should be left in the body of the dynamic document, and should revisit the folded sections I added in Weeks 5-7.
#### Questions
*approach 2 unit costs of deworming treatment*
* Why do we sum over t = 0 to 1.4? Is this because the average per capita cost of deworming over the entire treatment period is $1.40?  

I worked for **9 hours** this week.
