# Week 9

### Tasks

1. *Continue adding narrative descriptions for equations in 05_final_opa.Rmd*   

I revised the description for cost of schooling under approach 2. I also added a folded section for equation 18 (costs for evidence action approach) and wrote narrative description. I think my description sounds redundant compared to the previously existing description.

Under approach 3, I wasn't sure how to interpret the terms listed under equation (19).

I wasn't able to get to the 9-11 hours of training in R/policy analysis this week.

 I worked for **5 hours** this week.
