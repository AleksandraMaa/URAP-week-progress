# Week 3
## Tasks
1. *How to initialize git in terminal + write tutorial for future reference:*   

  Initially, I wasn't able to update a forked repository. I followed instructions from [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52522565/git-is-not-working-after-macos-update-xcrun-error-invalid-active-developer-pa) to correct the issue- I had to update Xcode Command-line Tools after updating to macOS Catalina.  

  In your terminal, put the following command:
  * xcode-select --install  

    Then a separate window prompts you to update Xcode Command Line tools. This allows you to update a forked repository using [these instructions](https://github.com/BITSS-OPA/URAP-week-progress/blob/master/04-sophia/02_week_log.md).

  [To launch GitHub in from the command line](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop/launching-github-desktop-from-the-command-line), open the GitHub Desktop menu and click **Install Command Line Tool**. Now you can open GitHub Desktop menu by typing *github* in your terminal.  (note: I don't think I correctly understood what initializing git in terminal meant)

2. *finish reading 05 and update code chunk around 1089 (function dependency map - describes how functions interact with each other): write inputs and outputs; review and update as needed*  

  I spent most of my hours this week trying to understand the function dependency map. For the most part I believe that the map is consistent with how I understood the functions to interact in the earlier section of the paper. The only edits I made were to errors in spelling that I noticed. I reviewed the relevant inputs for *wage_t* and for the first part of *earnings1_f* (up to line 1187).

I worked for **10 hours** this week on tasks 1 and 2.
