# Week 8

### Tasks
1. *Continue adding narrative descriptions for equations in 05_final_opa.Rmd*   

Continuing from last week, I read through approach 3 (Evidence Action). I didn't add a description for equation 18 because I think the current description "a weighted average of the unit cost across countries" is straightforward. For the rest of approach 3 I think I'd need more information to write narrative descriptions.  

After approach 3, I revised earlier descriptions under *common structure* (benefits), *approach 1* (gains in earnings) and *approach 2* (gains in earnings, direct cost).   

I worked for **9 hours** this week.
