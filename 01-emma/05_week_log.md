# Week 5
## Tasks
1. *Create narrative descriptions for equations in 05*  
I added narrative descriptions for equations in 2.1, 2.2.1, and 2.2.1.1 and created a collapsible "Equations" section like the one for equations (1) under 2.1. Under 2.2.1.2 and 2.2.1.3, I wasn't sure whether to add a descriptions for the initial wage (w<sub>0</sub>) or for the self-employed wage (w<sub>se</sub>), since the accompanying descriptions seemed like they provided the necessary information.

I worked for **8 hours** this week on task 1.
